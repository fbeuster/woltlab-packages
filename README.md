# WoltLab Example Packages

In this repository, I collect all the WoltLab packages which I've created over time. During development, it was hard for me to find good documentation and working examples. That's why I decided to share mine here.

## List of Examples
- [Account Change Notifitcation](account_change_notification)
- [Registration Forward](registration_forward)

## Disclaimer
I would consider myself as a beginner in developing for the WoltLab Suite. This means that the examples might not be perfect, follow the best practices for developing for the WoltLab Suite. Also, there might be better ways to implement the features. Feel free to open an issue if you have any suggestions or questions (though again, I'm a WoltLab beginner, therefore support might be limited).
